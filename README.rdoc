= Rspec Cells

<em>Spec your Cells.</em>

This plugin allows you to test your cells easily using RSpec. Basically, it adds a cells example group with a <tt>#render_cell</tt> helper.

Cells is Rails' popular {view components framework}[http://github.com/apotonick/cells].

= Installation

This gem runs with RSpec2 and Rails 3.0, so just add it to your app's +Gemfile+.

  group :test do
    gem "rspec-cells"


= Usage

Simply put all your specs in the <tt>spec/cells</tt> directory. However, let the cell generator do that for you!

  rails g cell blog_post show -t rspec

will create an exemplary <tt>spec/cells/blog_post_cell_spec.rb</tt> for you.

== Webrat

Webrat matchers just work as you might have expected - here is how a simple spec could look like.

  describe PostsCell do
    it "should render the posts count" do
      render_cell(:posts, :count).should have_selector("p", :content => "4 posts!")
    end
  end

== Capybara

If you want Capybara's string matchers be sure to bundle at least capybara +0.4.1+ in your Gemfile.

  gem "capybara", "~> 0.4.1"

You can then use capybara's matchers in your cell spec.

  describe PostsCell do
    describe "search posts" do
      let(:search) { render_cell(:posts, :search) }

      it "should have a search field" do
        search.should have_field("Search by Title")
      end

      it "should have a search button" do
        search.should have_button("Search")
      end
    end

    describe "latest posts" do
      subject { render_cell(:posts, :latest) }

      it { should have_css("h3.title", :text => "Latest Posts") }
      it { should have_table("latest_posts") }
      it { should have_link("View all Posts") }
      it { should_not have_button("Create Post") }
      it { should_not have_field("Search by Title") }
    end
  end

  You can see all capybara matchers and finders here: http://rubydoc.info/github/jnicklas/capybara/master/Capybara/Node/Simple
